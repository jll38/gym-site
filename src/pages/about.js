              <div className="indent-[2rem] font-medium">
                At Atlas Gym, we&apos;re more than just a fitness center;
                we&apos;re a community dedicated to helping individuals reach
                their personal zenith. Founded in 2010 by a trio of health and
                fitness enthusiasts - John, Sarah, and Mike - who were driven by
                their passion for helping people discover their physical
                potential, Atlas Gym was born. Over the years, we&apos;ve stayed
                true to our roots while evolving to meet the needs of a diverse
                community. Starting in a modest 2000 sq ft facility, our
                founders realized the demand for a gym that catered not just to
                bodybuilders and fitness models, but also to everyday people
                seeking to lead healthier lives. Today, Atlas Gym has
                grown to become a household name in the fitness industry.
                We&apos;ve expanded to over 20,000 sq ft, equipped with
                state-of-the-art fitness equipment, diverse workout spaces, and
                an array of innovative programs. Our commitment to providing an
                inclusive fitness environment has led us to house over 10,000
                active members from all walks of life.

              <h2 className="text-3xl text-black font-semibold">Our Vision</h2>
